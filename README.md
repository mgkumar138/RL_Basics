## Basics of reinforcement learning

This repository aims to compile the 3 algorithms used in tabular reinforcement learning
1. Model-free: SARSA, Q-Learning, Actor-Critic
2. Model-Based: Dyna-SARSA, Dyna-Q, Dyna-AC
3. Successor Representation: SARSA, Q-Learning

The first two algorithms can be found in Sutton & Barto: An introduction to Reinforcement learning (2020) textbook. 
The second algorithm was initially developed by Dayan 1993 to combine the efficiency of model-free algorithms and 
flexibility of model-based algorithms.

These algorithms are tested on either a Linear Maze or a 2D Grid world with a single rewarding state. 

## Motivation
Writing out these tabular code by hand helped me learn these concepts better. Hope they can help you understand the basics
of reinforcement learning too!
